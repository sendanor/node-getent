### This project moved to https://gitlab.com/kingloud/node-getent

node-getent
===========

Get entries from administrative databases for Node.js.

It's Node.js implementation of the features in the getent system command. 

Why use system calls and not read filesystem?
---------------------------------------------

Some systems don't use files like `/etc/passwd`. 

For example if you are using a LDAP-based systems you must use standard system calls.

By using calls you don't need to bother what type of database the system is currently using.

Install
-------

You can install it using NPM: `npm install getent`

Features
--------

Currently supports only these database:

* `passwd`

TODO
----

Generic stuff to do:

* Write unit tests
* Setup travis-ci

Implement these new databases:

* Database passwd - Implement `getpwnam` and `getpwuid` -- Current search does NOT use these!
* Database group - Implement `getgrent` etc
* Database hosts - Implement ` gethostent`
* Database services - Implement `getservent`
* Database protocols - Implement `getprotoent` etc
* Database networks - Implement `getnetent`

Also maybe these (which were not documented for getent command):

* Database shadow - Implement `getspent`, `getspnam`, etc
* Database alias - Implement `getaliasent` etc
* Database rpc - Implement `getrpcent` etc
* Database tty - Implement `getttyent` etc
* Database mnt - Implement `getmntent`

If this library some day has more features than the original command, then it should have runnable `node-getent` when installed globally.

Feel free to submit issues if you would like to see another feature or would need one of these implemented sooner. I'll accept pull requests, too!

Examples
--------

First you must define `getent` like this (did you expect something else?):

```javascript
var getent = require('getent');
```

Fetch all users using a callback:

```javascript
getent.passwd(function(user) {
	console.log( JSON.stringify(user) );
});
```

Fetch all users by returning an array:

```javascript
var users = getent.passwd();
```

Fetch single user:

```javascript
var users = getent.passwd("root");
```

Fetch two users:

```javascript
var users = getent.passwd(["root", "nobody"]);
```
